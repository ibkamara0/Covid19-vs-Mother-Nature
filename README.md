# Covid19-vs-Mother-Nature
Did the project out of my sheer enjoyment of data science. I wanted to one see if I could visualize some good news, then two, gain experience in different areas of data science.
## Overview
- Web scraped, read, parsed and cleaned data for easier implementation into model
- Created a visual representation of the relationship between increase in weather temperature and increase of Covid19 confirmed cases.
- Used machine learning to generate a model that displays a linear correlation between the two variables
- Extracted meaningful information from large dataset
## Resources and Data Acquisition
- Packages: scipy, sklearn, statistics, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy
- **Kaggle Data**: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset
- **Weather Data**: https://www.accuweather.com/

## Data Preprocessing
- Web scraped data from accuweather.com 
### Web Scraping
